Project Idea - SF B'n'b

Selma and Felix moved to Munich. All their friends and family want to visit them. As there is a long list of people wanting to visit, my project aims to help them plan their guests better.
The SF B'n'b enables Selma and Felix's friends to find dates when they want to visit. As well as find out more about what activities they can do e.g. skiing or hiking.

Key Features:
1. Landing page displaying all the SF attractions 
2. Authentication / login for guests to create profiles 
3. Guests can book trips and review past trips with profile 
4. Guests reviews are stored in database 
5. All people can read reviews on the website
